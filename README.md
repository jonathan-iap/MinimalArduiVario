# MinimalArduiVario

A simple __variometer__.

It's a project based on an _"ATmega328p"_ and Software is written on ["Arduino langage"](https://www.arduino.cc/). But not with "Arduino IDE". For this I have used ["platformIO"](http://platformio.org/) with ["Atom"](https://atom.io/) as text editor.

Poject is initialised accordingly.
You can still compile and run program on "Arduino IDE"

Software is inspired by :  http://wildlab.org/index.php/2015/07/07/arduino-variometer/


For the Hardware, i use an ATmega328p, a cheap BMP180 sensor, a buzzer and a 3V coin cell. This is the minimal setup. For more flexibility i add three buttons. To set sensibility, volume and enable/disable falling detection.
A fourth button is added as on/off push button.
